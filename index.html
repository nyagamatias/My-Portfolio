        <p>The story of the eagle is quite an inspiration to me that motivates me to make sacrifices for the future.
            The eagle has the longest life-span of its species of about 70 years. But for it to reach this age it 
            must make a very difficult decision.That is to undergo the process of change or die since at its 40th 
            age it can no longer capture prey. The process of change takes about 150 days and after the process of
            change the eagle lives for an additional 30 years.

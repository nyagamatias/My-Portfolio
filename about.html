            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Nairobi, Kenya. I learned everything i needed to know there. Everything that had to do with life that is.
                I started my education here where i attended pre-school in Blue Sky school. I then took my middle school studies in Mount 
                Kenya Academy in Nyeri. I graduated to high school and went to Utumishi Boys Academy where i finished my high school studies.
                I am currently doing my programming studies at Moringa School located in Nairobi,Ngong road.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason behind me taking up programming is beacause of its many advantages which include;
            <ul>
                <li>My passion towards it.</li>
                <li>It guarantees one a job.</li> 
                <li>You can create anything you want.</li>
                <li>You learn to combine technical skills and creativity.</li>
                <li>You develop problem solving skills.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have an interest in music.Currently i'm linked to a music group called "Wafalme" based in Umoja. Besides that i venture in all
                genres of music. One of my favourite hobbies is swimming. Swimming is fun and also improves ones health as proved by physicians 
                since it exercises all parts of the body. I am equipped with good communication skills, that is listening and speaking.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        
         <p>The story of the eagle is quite an inspiration to me that motivates me to make sacrifices for the future.
            The eagle has the longest life-span of its species of about 70 years. But for it to reach this age it 
            must make a very difficult decision.That is to undergo the process of change or die since at its 40th 
            age it can no longer capture prey. The process of change takes about 150 days and after the process of
            change the eagle lives for an additional 30 years.
